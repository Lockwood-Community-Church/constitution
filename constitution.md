# Constitution of Lockwood Community Church

## PREAMBLE:

The people of Lockwood Community Church shall be a people committed: to Christ, to Christ-
likeness, to each other, to the world.

## ARTICLE I. NAME

The name of this organization shall be Lockwood Community Church (LCC).

## ARTICLE II. TENETS OF FAITH

1. There is one **God**, eternally existing in three persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy
   Spirit. (Deut. 6:4; Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14; Heb. 9:14)

2. **God** is sovereign in creation, revelation, redemption and final judgment. (Gen. 1:1; Deut.
    29:29; 1 Cor. 1:30; Acts 17:31)

3. The **Bible**, as originally given, is the inspired and infallible Word of God. The entire Bible
    is the supreme authority and is sufficient in all matters of belief and behavior. (2 Tim.
    3:16-17; 2 Pet. 1:20-21; Ps. 19:7-11)

4. **Man** was created in the image of God but Adam disobeyed God and sinned. Since the
    fall, the whole of mankind is sinful and guilty so that everyone is subject to God’s wrath
    and condemnation. (Rom. 3:23; Rom. 1:18-20; Rom. 5:12)

5. The **Lord Jesus Christ**, God’s incarnate Son is fully God. He was born of a virgin; His
    humanity is real and sinless; He died on the cross, was raised bodily from death and
    now has authority over heaven and earth. (Col. 1:19-20, 2:9; Matt. 1:23; Rom. 8:3; Heb.
    7:26; l Cor. 15:1-7; Matt. 28:18-20)

6. Christ has obtained eternal redemption for sinful human beings. Through his sacrificial
    death he has redeemed people from the curse of the Law, from wickedness, and from
    their empty way of life so they can experience blessing now and in the age to come.
    (Titus 2:14, 1 Peter 1:18, Galatians 3:13-14, Romans 3:23-24)

7. Those who believe in Christ are forgiven, justified before God, and accepted by him. This
    justification is God’s act of undeserved mercy, received solely by faith in Christ Jesus
    and not by their own efforts.

8. It is the Holy Spirit who makes the work of Christ effective to individual sinners. He
    empowers them to turn to God from their sin and to trust in Jesus Christ. (Jn. 16:7-11)

9. The **Holy Spirit** lives in all those He has given spiritual birth. He enables them to become
   increasingly Christ-like in character and behavior and gives them power and gifts for
   their witness in the world. (Gal. 5:22-25, Acts 1:8)

10. The only holy, universal **church** is the Body of Christ to which all true believers belong.
    This universal church finds expression in local fellowships, who gather for worship,
    edification and proclamation of the gospel. (Eph. 4:4; Acts 2:41-42)

11. The **Lord Jesus Christ** will return in person to judge everyone; to receive the redeemed
    into eternal glory and to execute God’s just condemnation on those who have not
    believed and repented. (Acts 1:11; 2 Thess. 1:7-10; Matt. 25)

### ARTICLE III. OUR CHURCH COVENANT

We believe that the church exists to bring God glory (Eph. 1:6) and that we may do so by
EXALTING God in worship, by EDIFYING one another, by EVANGELIZING our community and
world, and by EQUIPPING ourselves for God’s service. We covenant together:

1. To regularly attend the worship gatherings at LCC (Heb. 10:24) and earnestly seek
    God’s aid to **exalt** Him in worship in spirit and truth.

2. To **edify** one another to live distinctively Christian lives (Eph. 1:4; 2 Cor. 7:1) by devoting
    ourselves to develop loving relationships with our Christian family (Ro. 12:10), by
    accepting one another in the spirit of Christ (Ro. 15:7), by serving one another (Gal.
    5:13), especially in times of need, by bearing with those with whom we have differences
    (Eph. 4:2), and by encouraging one another (1 Thess. 5:11) to be true to God and His
    purpose in our lives.

3. To **evangelize** our world by sharing God’s love and forgiveness with those outside Christ
    (2 Cor. 5:19; 1 Jn. 3:17), and by supporting the church with prayers and contributions in
    its effort to advance the Gospel locally and internationally through its missionary
    outreach.

4. To be **equipped** to serve God by regular Bible study (2 Tim. 3:16) and prayer (Eph.
    6:18), and by developing the spiritual gifts God has given through involvement in church
    ministry. (Eph. 4: 11 - 16 )

## ARTICLE IV. ORDINANCES OF THE CHURCH

The ordinances of the church are Baptism and the Lord’s Supper. These are not prerequisites
for salvation.

## ARTICLE V. FORM OF CHURCH GOVERNMENT

1. LCC is autonomous and maintains the right to govern itself and to conduct its own affairs,
    including without limitation, the calling of a Senior Pastor, the selection of Leadership,
    and the implementation of its own ministries. LCC shall also have the right to purchase
    or acquire by gift, bequest or otherwise, either directly or as trustee, and to own, hold in
    trust, use, sell, convey, lease, or otherwise dispose of any real estate or property as may
    be necessary for the furtherance of its purposes, and to exercise all other powers
    conferred upon it by its State of Michigan, other applicable laws of the State of Michigan.

    LCC is, and shall remain, independent but may from time to time voluntarily join itself to
    others for the purposes of fulfilling our ministry objectives. LCC shall not be subject to
    any governing body other than its own local corporate entity. LCC retains the right to
    terminate any associations with others at any time.

2. LCC shall be governed by its **covenant partners**. The covenant partners shall regulate
    LCC affairs under the authority of Christ, in keeping with the will of God as expressed in
    the Scriptures. Authority will be vested by the covenant partners in the Elders, who shall
    provide spiritual ministry to the church, and Deacons, who shall provide practical
    ministry, as God has directed; and in the Elders, Deacons, Administration Board and the
    Trustees as elected by the church family (see below Article VI, Section 3). The final
    responsibility to fulfill and maintain the will of Christ in the church’s corporate life rests
    with the church family. The will of both covenant partners and others committed to Christ
    and the Lockwood church family will be sought in determining consensus (as defined in
    Article VI, Section 3).

3. The officers of this corporation currently are the Senior Pastor, the Chair of the
    Administration Board, and the Treasurer.

## ARTICLE VI. MEETINGS

1. An annual meeting of the church shall be held on the fourth Tuesday in January to focus
    our direction, vision, and priorities for the coming year. Also, the covenant partners will
    recognize and affirm the church’s leadership, adopt a new budget and conduct other
    business the Elders and Administrative Board shall bring before it. Additional business
    meetings may be called as needed.

2. The church may convene a meeting of itself, in coordination with the Administrative
    Board. Any such meeting and its purpose must be announced two weeks prior (unless
    the meeting’s purpose is time sensitive, in that case, the meeting shall be held and its
    purpose be announced as soon as possible) to the event through normal channels of
    communication.

3. Decisions of the church shall be made by consensus (after a quorum has been
    established; see Article VII). Consensus is defined as a sense of accord, harmony, and
    unity of mind that indicates our essential agreement on a matter. Though voice vote,
    hand vote, or secret balloting may be used to finalize consensus, it will often require the
    wise and godly evaluation of the thoughts and concerns of the people during church
    family interaction. The Elders, with the help of the Deacons, are charged with the
    responsibility of determining when there is consensus. A guiding principle in the
    decision-making process is the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

## ARTICLE VII. QUORUM

Covenant partners in attendance at business meetings will constitute a quorum, unless the
Elders, in consultation with the Deacons, do not think that a sufficient representation is present.
If it is determined that a quorum is not present, no official business may be conducted.

## ARTICLE VIII. AMENDMENTS

These articles may be amended through alteration, addition, or subtraction by consensus of a
quorum at any business meeting of the church. The church (officials and congregants) shall be
apprised, in writing, of the proposed change at least 2 weeks prior to formal consideration of
the proposed amendment(s).
